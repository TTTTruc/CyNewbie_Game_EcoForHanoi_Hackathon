1.
Game duration: 5 days first. Weather system: include all your recommendation. Quiz events: include all your recommendation. Visual style: cartoon/illustrated vibe. Music / Sound Effects: add placeholder audio. 

2.
here are the features i wanted to add and modify: 
- take pokemon game as a design reference but not in pixel styles (as i want it to be visualize as a map)
- add a static bar on the top, showing the the total CO2 spent in that day, total coins, total of trees user have planted, and a user profile

3. 
based on the information above, create a user stories that cover the flow of the web

4.
UI ENHANCEMENT:
- improve the map so that it look like the reference image style (use visual to demontrate each location, obstacles)
- the map includes these 7 locations: 
1/Home (placed on the left, displaying the inside layout of home (in a floor plan layout), including bedroom, kitchen, living room and a yard. Each area should be visualize with 1-2 simple interiors. the yard will include a bike and a motorbike) 
2/Entrance between Home and Outside (there is a road connect home's yard to the outside streets and location. there is a bus station locate in this area) 
3/School (display the school campus including 3 buildings: the main school building, library, canteen) 
4/Company (display the company building) 
5/Food stall (there are 3 food stalls lying separately on the map, 1 sell phở and hủ tiếu, 1 sell office lunch, 1 sell dessert like cottan candy, flans...) 
6/Coffee shop
7/Fine dining restaurant

- Includes 2-3 more bus station across the map (1 near the school, 1 near the company)
- COLOR PALETTE for each location (use that as the main color palette for the whole website too): 
Home: #A8C686
Transportation: #B0B0B0
School: #8ED1A0
Company/Factory Zone: #7C7C7C
Food Stalls: #D7A86E
Coffee shop #F6D6AD 
Fine Dining: #4C6054

- Generate art for each location based on the style of the reference image

GAME FLOW ENHANCEMENT:
- when the character enter each location, it will pop up a modal with list of actions
 +Bedroom in home: take a nap; go to sleep (this will activate the end day button instead of at least 3 phases are completed)
 + Kitchen in home: cook breakfast; cook afternoon meal; cook dinner
 + Living room in home: watch TV
 + Home will have an option to choose use a fan or an AC (each emit different CO2)
 + Transportation: walk (when character navigate manually); bike (when click on the bike in the yard); motorbike (when click on the motorbike in the yard); bus (when click on each bus station). when navigate using transportation other than walking, it will pop up a modal showing other locations options. user will see the moving motion of that certain transportation move to the destination point. when arrive, the transporation will locate at that location and the character appear again.
 + if character at school or company, it will automatically emit a certain level of CO2 due to the use of AC
 + Each food stalls, coffee shop and restaurant will pop up a modal list some items menu (3-4 items) when character arrive those ddestinations.

CALCULATE the coins and CO2 cost for the new options based on the old metrics.

UPDATE the user stories and specific document based on the enhancement

specific document: "# Week in Hanoi: Carbon Quest — Developer Specification

**Owner:** al
**Game Type:** 2D choice-based map adventure (Pokémon-like overworld, non‑pixel)
**Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no backend). Optional libraries allowed only if they run fully client-side.
**Target:** Desktop + mobile web

---

## 1) Project Goals

* Teach players how daily choices of Hanoi university students affect CO₂ emissions.
* Simulate **5 in‑game days**, then let players **invest coins** to reduce net CO₂ (trees, solar, bike-sharing, reusable bottle).
* Add **weather randomizer** and **random events** that modify outcomes.
* Visualize movement on a **city map** with POIs (morning, transport, lunch, study, evening).
* Show a fixed **top HUD** with **CO₂ Today**, **Coins**, **Trees planted**, and **Profile**.
* Include ambient music + click SFX (toggleable).

---

## 2) Player Flow (High-level)

1. **Index (Menu):** Play / Learn / About.
2. **Game Day Start:** Randomize weather; show banner with modifiers.
3. **Overworld Map:** Player moves to POIs → opens a modal with choices.
4. **Choices Apply:** CO₂ & coins adjusted; random event ~25% chance.
5. **Daily Quiz:** Once per day, award coins on correct answer.
6. **End of Day Summary:** Show totals + tip → advance to next day.
7. **After Day 5:** Investments screen → reduce CO₂ using coins, show visual improvement.
8. **Final Report:** Totals, rank, replay.

---

## 3) Core Mechanics

* **CO₂ accounting:** Each choice adds/subtracts CO₂; weather & events can modify.
* **Coins:** Awarded for eco choices and quiz correctness; spent on investments.
* **Trees:** Count shown in HUD; some investments directly increase it.
* **Weather:** Sunny / Rainy / Cloudy / Smoggy → modifiers.
* **Random Events:** Traffic jam, power cut, discount day, environmental campaign, sick day.

---

## 4) HUD (Fixed Top Bar)

Elements (left → right):

* **Day tag**: `Day N / 5`.
* **CO₂ Today**: e.g., `1.75 kg` (resets each day; includes smog baseline).
* **Coins**: integer.
* **Trees**: integer (lifetime in run).
* **Profile**: avatar emoji + name (editable via prompt modal), optional mute/unmute toggle.

**Acceptance:** HUD persists on scroll, updates live after every choice/event.

const state = {
  day: 1,
  daysTotal: 5,
  co2Today: 0,
  co2Total: 0,
  coins: 0,
  trees: 0,
  weather: null,            // 'sunny' | 'rainy' | 'cloudy' | 'smoggy'

---

## 16) Implementation Plan (Phased)

**Phase 1 — Scaffolding (0):**

* Create folders & base HTML files; wire CSS/JS imports.
* Render map grid; keyboard movement; walkable tiles.

**Phase 2 — HUD & Weather (1):**

* Implement sticky HUD + status banner.
* `startDay()` with weather randomizer & baseline CO₂.

**Phase 3 — POIs & Choices (2):**

* POI detection; modal list; apply CO₂/coins; weather modifiers; toasts.
* Random events (25%).

**Phase 4 — Quizzes & Day Summary (3):**

* Show one quiz per day; award coins.
* End-of-day summary; advance day; reset per-day state.

**Phase 5 — Investments & Final Report (4):**

* Investment screen; apply reductions; tree count.
* Final results screen, rank calc; Replay.

**Phase 6 — Audio & Polish (5):**

* Ambient loop, SFX, mute toggle; accessibility; mobile controls.

---

## 17) Acceptance Criteria (Key)

* **Navigation:** Menu → Game Day 1; About works.
* **Map:** Movement restricted to walkable; POI modal auto-opens on entry.
* **HUD:** Day/co₂/coins/trees/profile all update immediately; sticky on scroll.
* **Weather:** Banner reflects selection; modifiers applied correctly; smog adds baseline.
* **Events:** ~25% chance after actions; toast shows deltas; numbers update.
* **Quiz:** One per day; correct grants coins; shows fact; cannot repeat same day.
* **End of Day:** Requires ≥ 3 actions; shows daily totals; day increments; resets per-day values.
* **Investments:** Costs deducted; reductions applied; trees count increases; shows visual change.
* **Final Report:** Displays totals, net reductions, rank; Replay resets all state.
* **Audio:** Plays by default; toggle mutes all; preference persists.

---

## 18) Testing Checklist

* Keyboard controls on desktop; tap controls (if added) on mobile.
* Weather modifier math (sunny bonus, rainy penalty, smog baseline).
* Event chance calibrated; no double application.
* Quiz lockout per day; randomization without repeats until pool exhausted.
* End-of-day only after minimum actions; daily reset correctness.
* Investment calculations: co₂Total minus reductions; trees increment.
* Performance: 60fps movement, no layout thrash; image assets optimized.
* Accessibility: Tab into modals; Escape closes; readable contrast; ARIA roles for dialogs.

---

## 19) Performance & Accessibility

* Avoid large images; prefer inline SVG; lazy-load non-critical assets.
* Use `prefers-reduced-motion` to simplify movement/animations.
* Respect reduced‑motion for ambient audio auto‑play (gate on user interaction).

---

## 20) Future Extensions (Backlog)

* Local leaderboard (lowest net CO₂) via `localStorage`.
* Rainy‑day pathing effects; puddle tiles.
* NPCs with dialog tips (AQI facts, Hanoi campus trivia).
* Streak bonuses for consecutive eco days.
* Multi-language: vi/en toggle.

---

## 21) Dev Notes

* All numbers are placeholders for gameplay balance; keep values centralized in `config.js`.
* Keep UI copy short; use tooltips and concise facts.
* Protect against double‑clicks on modal choices; disable buttons after click.
* Ensure all state changes go through a single source of truth (`game.js`), UI reads from state.

**Done = Playable loop across 5 days with investments, accurate counters, and polished HUD.**
"

6. 
here is the updated plan, modify the code to the following: "# Carbon Quest — Synthesized User Stories & Dev Spec (Updated)

**Working title:** *Week in Hanoi: Carbon Quest*
**Platform:** Web (HTML/CSS/JS only)
**Style:** Pokémon-like overworld (non‑pixel), illustrated map
**Run length:** 5 in‑game days + Investments stage
**Top HUD:** Day / CO₂ Today / Coins / Trees / Profile (sticky)

---

## 1) Purpose & Learning Goal

Players live 5 days as a Hanoi uni student. Every choice (transport, meals, venue time, home climate) changes **CO₂** and **Coins**. After 5 days, coins fund **green actions** to reduce total CO₂. Weather & random events nudge decisions.

---

## 2) Global Visual System

### 2.1 Color Tokens

```
--ink:#1f2937; --muted:#64748b; --card:#ffffff; --shadow:rgba(0,0,0,.12);
--road:#E7D1A7; --water:#9EC7FF; --grass:#E9F7E6;

--home:#A8C686;              /* Home */
--transport:#B0B0B0;         /* Bus stops / transport UI */
--school:#8ED1A0;            /* School campus */
--company:#7C7C7C;           /* Company zone */
--food:#D7A86E;              /* Food stalls */
--coffee:#F6D6AD;            /* Coffee shop */
--fine:#4C6054;              /* Fine dining */
```

Use these both in map styling and site UI.

### 2.2 Map Composition

* Layers: base terrain → roads (rounded) → obstacles (trees, hedges, rocks, ponds) → POIs → markers.

* **Coffee shop (x1)**.
* **Fine dining (x1)**.
* **Optional Bus Stop #4** (balance pathing, if needed).

## 8) State Model (game.js)

```js
state = {
  day: 1, daysTotal: 5,
  co2Today: 0, co2Total: 0,
  coins: 0, trees: 0,
  weather: null, todaysMods: {},
  quizDoneToday: false, actionsDoneToday: 0,
  homeClimate: 'fan',               // 'fan' | 'ac'
  pos: {x:2, y:6}, gridW:15, gridH:10,
  vehicles: { parked: { bike: 'home', moto: 'home' } },
  visitedFlags: { school:false, company:false }, // reset on exit
  profile: { name:'Linh', avatar:'🎒', title:'Student • Hanoi' }
}
```

Transitions: `startDay()` → weather & baseline → play; `onPOIAction()` applies deltas + maybeEvent + maybeQuiz; `enterVenue()` applies auto load once; `sleepEndDay()` bypasses phase rule; `endOfDay()` aggregates; `investments()`; `finalReport()`.

---

## 9) Interaction Specs

* **Destination Picker** (bike/moto/bus): list of reachable POIs (bus limited to stops/zones). After choose → animate along road polyline; park vehicle; respawn avatar.
* **Reusable toggles** in menus: checkbox row updates previewed totals before confirm.
* **Auto load guard:** per venue `visitedFlags` set on entry; cleared on exit bounds.
* **Quiz cadence:** trigger once after first or second action each day; pool without repeat; +3 coins on correct; short fact after answer.
* **Summary:** show CO₂ Today, Coins gained, top emitter category, 1 tip.

if there is no svg to input, just create that directories in the asset folder and leave it blank, i will fill it in late

7.
i just add these file in the assets/images folder, but they are all png file, not svg. add the image to the code so that the UI displayed as documented "home_floorplan.svg, entrance_bus.svg, school_campus.svg, company_block.svg, stall_pho.svg, stall_lunch.svg, stall_dessert.svg, cafe.svg, fine_dining.svg, bus_stop.svg, obstacles_pack.svg"
