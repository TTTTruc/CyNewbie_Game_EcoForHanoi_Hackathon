I am planning to make a vibing code about real situation of air pollution in Ha Noi. I want to focus on daily routine of Hanoi university students and how their routines affect CO2 production (For example: riding a motorbike instead of taking a bus will produce ... CO2) And at the end of the day, we will calculate and finalize how much CO2 is produced. I want a story board about real life of Hanoi university student first. Can you help me with the game story board (detailed options)

There will be random questions to gain coins, and after 5 days of playing, if we want to improve the CO2 pollution, we can pay coins to plant trees or anything like that

Awesome, for optional gameplay features, I would like the weather randomizer and events. I would love to generate vibing code for this game
