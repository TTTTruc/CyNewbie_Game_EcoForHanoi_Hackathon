1.
you are the best game developer.
there are a few bugs. modify the code to fix it.
- when character at any bus station and choose the destination is another bus station, there is a moving motion like when character use a bike or motorbike to the destination
- when user take any kind of transportation, the moving motion will be the image of that transportation. when arrive at the destinatition, the transportation disappear, the character reappear
- when character take a bike or a motorbike to another desitination, the vehicle remain at that transportation. when click on that location or character re-enter that location, there is a modal pop up showing there is a vehicle and allow user to use that vehicle to navigate
- clear the vehicle existance from a location if that vehicle is not in that location anymore

2.
make some UI adjustment:
- each grid square size 48px x 48px
- each location image should be 240px x 240px
- each transportation image is 48px x 48px
- visualize the path that character can step on in the color of orange (make it 1 line, the road can split and have intersection)
- the remain area is blocked (which user can not step onto), make it green
- the label of each location locate at the bottom of the location

3.
expand the area game-wrap so that all the images fit into the section instead of overlay, i want the each location to take up 4 grid square

4.
now overall UI adjustment and enhancement:
- the layer structure of game: the grid background, the images, the label, the transportation, the character, the pop up modal, the HUD
- Each location takes up 4 spaces, those 4 spaces' background color is white, and is accessible
- add more columns and rows to the game-wrap and separate each location by more than 1 row or column.
- debug the road path as when user try to navigate to other destination, using vehicle, it show no road path

5.
If the bike or motorbike pixel framework is entirely inside the pixel framework of the location, then after player make a decision to use the bike or motorbike to go to a destination, both player and bike or motorbike will go to the destination as well
